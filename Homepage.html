  <h3>About What?</h3>
  <p>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.</p>

Welcome to the Smart System Laboratory, which was established in the School of Mechanical, Robotics and Energy Engineering at Dongguk University. <br> <br>
Smart systems incorporate functions of sensing, actuation, and
control in order to describe and analyze a situation, and make
decisions based on the available data in a predictive or adaptive
manner, thereby performing smart actions. In most cases the
“smartness” of the system can be attributed to autonomous
operation based on closed loop control, energy efficiency, and
networking capabilities . Smart systems are increasingly used in
a large number of sectors. The Smart System Lab at DGU aims
at research that can be adapted in various fields .
